## Installation requirements on ubuntu

WCIVF requires Python 3.

To install:

    sudo apt-get install python3-dev libpq-dev libjpeg-dev redis-server
    pip install -r requirements/local.txt


## Installation requirements on macOS

Use homebrew to install the following dependencies:

    brew install postgresql jpeg postgis

If you want to use redis, this can also be installed with homebrew:
    
    brew install redis

Pyenv is recommended to install python versions. You can find installation instructions for pyenv [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) - installation via homebrew is recommended.

The python version that we are using for this project is specified in the `.python-version` file in the root of the directory.You can install this version with:

    pyenv install 3.10.4

The presence of a `.python-version` file means that pyenv will activate this version whenever in this directory. This means that whenever running a `python` command, the version specified in `.python-version` is used. You can check this with the below command:

    python --version

The output should match the version in `.python-version`. If the version is not installed, pyenv will output an error stating the version is not installed.

If there is no `.python-version` file you can use the following command to create one and activate that version for this project:

    pyenv local 3.10.4

When you are happy that you are using the correct python version, you are ready to create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) with the command:

    python -m venv env

This will create a virtual environment in the directory `env`. You can then activate the virtual environment with:

    source env/bin/activate

Check that the virtual environment is using the correct python version:

    python --version

The output should match the python version set in the `.python-version`. If it does not, something has gone wrong - delete the `env` directory and retry the steps to set the python version and create the virtual environment.

You can now install the project dependencies in to your activated virtualenv:

    pip install -r requirements/local.txt

You'll also need to make sure that you're set up with tidy. 
First install cmake:
```
# Mac
brew install cmake

# Linux
sudo apt-get install cmake
```
Once cmake is in place, follow the build steps in the tidy repository [here](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5).

Check that your env has correctly installed and project is working by running the tests:

    pytest

Gotcha: If you're using an M1 Mac, you may run into errors concerning GDAL and GEOS when you try to run the tests for the first time. 
If this affects you, you'll need to set the path for both of these libs in a local config. 

You can find your paths by running:
`geos-config --libs` and `gdal-config --libs`. 

In your local config, set the following:
```
GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH = "{YOUR PATH}/libgdal.dylib"
GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH= '{YOUR PATH}/libgeos_c.1.17.0.dylib'
```

## Code formatting

The project uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for code formatting. You can run it with:

    black .

Additionally, this project uses [ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/) for linting. You can run it with:

    ruff . 

ruff has in-built functionality to fix common linting errors. Use the `--fix` option to do this.

Both Black and ruff are both automatically called as part of pytest in this project.

A pre-commit hook is defined in the project to run it automatically before each commit. See the [pre-commit docs](https://pre-commit.com/#quick-start) for more information, or simply run the below command to setup:

    pre-commit install


## Database setup

Create a Postgres database as detailed [below](#setting-up-postgresql-and-postgis), then:

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py import_parties
    python manage.py import_ballots
    python manage.py import_people

If you want election results, you'll also need to import them:

    python manage.py import_ballots --current

If you don't want to install Redis for some reason (like e.g. laziness) you can override
the cache backend with a file at `./wcivf/settings/local.py` with the following:

    CACHES = {
        'default': {
           'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.dummy.DummyCache',
        }
    }


## Setting up PostgreSQL and PostGIS

By default WhoCanIVoteFor uses PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension. To set this up locally, first install the packages:

    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgis

Then create, for example, a `wcivf` user:

    sudo -u postgres createuser -P wcivf

Set the password to, for example, `wcivf`. Then create the database, owned by the `wcivf` user:

    sudo -u postgres createdb -O wcivf wcivf

Finally, add the PostGIS extension to the database:

    sudo -u postgres psql -d wcivf -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"

Then, create a file `wcivf/settings/local.py` with the following contents, assuming you used the same username, password and database name as above:

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
            'NAME': 'wcivf',
            'USER': 'wcivf',
            'PASSWORD': 'wcivf',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '',
        }
    }

See the local.example file for other suggested settings to use for local development.

## Creating inline CSS

To regenerate the static files:

    manage.py collectstatic

The CSS for this project is inlined in the base template for performance reasons.

This is created using [`critical`](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical), and can be re-created by running

```
curl localhost:8000 | critical --base wcivf -m > wcivf/templates/_compressed_css.html
```

# Test Feedback Form changes to Slack Webhooks
You will need access to incoming webhooks page in the DC Slack account.

Once you have access, create a new webhook and select `slackbot` as the channel. 
Add that URL to your `local.py`: 

`SLACK_FEEDBACK_WEBHOOK_URL = "URL"`

Then, have your local install post to your channel in Slack.

Complete the feedback form on localhost, then run the management command `manage.py batch_feedback_to_slack --hours-ago=1`

Feedback should appear in your Slack channel.

# Update Welsh Translations

After adding new translation tags to a template, run `django-admin makemessages -l cy --ignore='env*'` then `django-admin compilemessages --ignore='env'` to generate matching translation strings to be translated.
